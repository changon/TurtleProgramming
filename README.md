# Turtle programming sandbox

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run server:

```
gulp dev
```

## To Program
- bulid reference side bar
- build module side bar
- bootstrap for prettify layout
- React(?) future future

## To Address
-Multiple languages. python (count lines for limits on goals)
-Goals:
  Conditionals
  Loops (simple AI maze follower)
  
  String processing - hangman
  
  Games: for future after trivial tasks.
  Cheatsheet for syntax
  
Other things: string processing, recursion
As modules, continue lower amount of code provided.
Open notes, harder from that.

Module 1:
Turtle programming.
Do basic tasks, draw things, get sense for dot operation, and functions, arithmetic, or things.

Module 2:
Conditionals: Age program
Loops: simple AI Maze follower
Arrays:
Function writing:

Module 3:
Days of the week problem. n days after dd/mm/year what day of week?
Is this year a leap year?
Basic logic
Draw basic competition problems.

Module 4:
Classes!

Extend turtle, and make space ship.

Module 5:
Tic-tac-toe

Module 6:
-Dodging crap from sky game
